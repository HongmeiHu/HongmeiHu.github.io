# Cochlear implant (CI) Models

![](/images/software/aacus230034.gif)
You can download our [single channel bilateral CI simulation model](https://zenodo.org/records/5571858) and [opensource framework for simulating the spatial hearing of bilateral CI users](https://zenodo.org/records/7471961). 

You can find the corresponding publications on [Hu et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10162-021-00823-1) and [Hu et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1051/aacus/2023036).

# Other resources

We also developed some speech test materials. For example, the Mandarin Chinese matrix sentence test [(CMNmatrix, Hu et al. 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2018.1483083) and the Cantonese matrix sentence test [ (YUEmaxtrix, Hu et al. 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2022.2142683). They are available at [HÃ¶rzentrum Oldenburg](https://www.hz-ol.de/en/home.html).

In addition to the official [(CMNmatrix, Hu et al. 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2018.1483083), we also recorded the Mandarin matrix sentence test with different speakers for both Lombard and plain speech [(Hu et al 2022), free available on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/7063030).

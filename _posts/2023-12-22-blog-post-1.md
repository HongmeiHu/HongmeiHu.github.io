I decide to build a GitHub personal webpage today. The website is forked from [mmistakes/minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)

# Jekyll

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

It took some time for me to choose between [Jekyll] (https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Both have pros and cons. At the end I decide to start with Jekyll for the github page.
